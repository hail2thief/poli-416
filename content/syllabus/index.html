<div id="what-is-this-course-about" class="section level2">
<h2>What is this course about?</h2>
<p>This is an undergraduate course on the study of civil wars, political violence, and other forms of armed conflict. Each week will be organized around a different topic related to the study of civil wars, including why civil wars break out, what tactics insurgents and states use during them, what happens when third-parties intervene, whether negotiations can effectively end wars, and other key questions in the conflict literature.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the course catalog has an antiquated description of the class.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-will-we-readdo-in-this-course" class="section level2">
<h2>What will we read/do in this course?</h2>
<p>Most of what we read in this course will cover civil wars and political violence as <strong>general phenomena</strong> (e.g., looking across the historical record of civil wars, why do they <strong>tend</strong> to emerge in some places but not others?). But we will also read case studies of conflicts I think are especially interesting.</p>
<p><em>All of the readings in this class are free.</em> You will be able to download them from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pide0ytvjrnbp0q/AADaIbprAmBQERw4UwWleAVba?dl=0">this Dropbox folder</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to reading, we will also spend a significant amount of time in this class <strong>working with data</strong> on political violence, through homework. We will explore general patterns and trends, think about how to measure different concepts related to political violence, and see to what extent different theories of political violence are supported by evidence. <em>Note: the class assumes no prior experience with data but you will need regular access to a computer.</em></p>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify structural and historical drivers of violence</li>
<li>Conceptualize armed conflict as a strategic process involving states, civilians, and armed groups</li>
<li>Explore, analyze, and interpret data bearing on political violence</li>
</ol>
<!-- **Note: A great thing about this class is that we get to dig into conflict processes across a wide range of countries and time periods. One downside of this is that there is lots of context that we don't get to develop for each case. Thankfully, we have the internet, and I expect you to do  -->
<div id="google-sheets" class="section level3">
<h3>Google Sheets</h3>
<p>All homeworks requiring data will be done in Google Sheets or Excel. <a href="http://sheets.google.com/">Google Sheets</a> is free to use with a Google account, and I will do all data analysis tutorials in Google Sheets. However, you can easily follow along in Excel if that’s what you prefer.</p>
</div>
<div id="warning-on-violentdisturbing-content" class="section level3">
<h3>Warning on Violent/Disturbing Content</h3>
<p>This course will involve spending a significant amount of time covering violent and/or disturbing material, which can be difficult to read about or watch. I will do my best to flag especially graphic content but ask that you please consider this in deciding whether to take the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="podcasts" class="section level3">
<h3>Podcasts</h3>
<p>You should listen to podcasts, although I won’t grade you on it. Below are some of my favorite podcasts that frequently discuss conflict and political violence:</p>

<div id="how-can-i-get-help-or-get-in-contact-with-the-instructors" class="section level2">
<h2>How can I get help or get in contact with the instructors?</h2>
<p><em>Ask for help on Slack</em>. We have a class Slack chanel where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about data (e.g., “how do I summarize multiple variables at once?”) or class logistics (e.g., “I can’t find the reading”) in the class Slack. The TA and I will monitor Slack regularly, and you should all do so as well. You’ll have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.</p>
<p><em>Go to Office Hours</em>. The TA’s office hours and my office hours are available on the home page and at the top of this page.</p>
<p><em>If you would like to speak with me about something that only pertains to you</em> (e.g., your grades, academic advice), you can sign up for my office hours on <a href="https://calendly.com/juan-f-tellez">Calendly</a>. If there’s a time-sensitive issue you can email me. Everything else goes in the Slack so that others can see and access help.</p>
</div>
<div id="are-lectures-recorded" class="section level2">
<h2>Are lectures recorded?</h2>
<p>Class lectures are not recorded. Students are not allowed to record class lecture with video or audio. The only exception is students with registered SDC accommodations.</p>
<div id="honor-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Honor Code</h3>
<p>Be nice. Don’t cheat. The <a href="https://ossja.ucdavis.edu/code-academic-conduct">Code of Academic Conduct</a> is in effect in this class and all others at the University. I will treat violations seriously. If you have doubts, it is your responsibility to ask about the Code’s application.</p>

<div id="counseling-psychiatry-services" class="section level3">

<h2>Crazy moments in IR</h2>
<p>Once you have read this entire syllabus and <a href="/assignments/">the assignments page</a>, I want you to find an image or screenshot of text from a “crazy moment” in international relations / world events / world history (inspired by this <a href="https://twitter.com/ampol_moment">Twitter account on American politics</a>). Almost anything counts as long as the event: 1) takes place outside the US or 2) if it involves the US, concerns American foreign policy. Post it to the Slack by January 20th and I’ll round up your final grade to the nearest percentage point.</p>
