<h2>Displacement in Colombia</h2>
<p>Let’s look at this survey data from Colombia, which captures responses from people living in very rural areas that have been affected by the conflict, and includes both people who were and weren’t displaced during the war (variable dictionary below). Every row here is a person who completed the survey.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>How many years has the average person in the sample been displaced?</p></li>
<li><p>How large (number of people) is the largest household in the sample?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the relationship between how old a respondent is and how long they have been displaced? Make a scatterplot (points) with respondent age on x-axis and years since displacement on the y axis, and add a trend line. Save the plot, you will submit it.</p></li>
<li><p>(Based on graph in question 3) In general, people who are older tend to have been displaced _____</p></li>
<li><p>About what percent of respondents who were displaced have <strong>ALSO</strong> been the victim of another form of violence beside displacement? Calculate the percent of respondents who have been victims of other forms of violence, filtering so you only look at respondents who have been displaced.</p></li>
<li><p>About what percent of the sample would favor the legalization of coca production? Take “strong approve” and “approve” to both mean they would favor legalization.</p></li>
<li><p><del>About what percent of respondents are seeking restitution of their lost property?</del> accidentally left this off the Canvas quiz, feel free to skip.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, compare the proportion of men and women who have managed to return to their community of origin. About how much more likely (how many percentage points more) are men to have returned to their origin community than women?</p></li>
