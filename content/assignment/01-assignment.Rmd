## Tutorial


Here's a [brief, kinda awkward tutorial](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6kc0g0xobuazlx2/filter-summary.mov?dl=0) on how to use Filter and Summary Statistics in Google Sheets. 


## Instructions



Answer the questions (below), and keep track of your answers somewhere (a notepad?). You will input your answers into Canvas. **Figure out the answers *BEFORE* opening Canvas**, otherwise you'll run out of time. 



## Data


You're going to work with a random sample from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program at The Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University in Oslo, Norway. The dataset is called the Geo-referenced Event Dataset (GED) which, as the title hints, provides detailed geo-referenced information on violent events around the world. 

- Download this: <i class="fas fa-download"></i> [UCDP GED Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6tthe5o22lgglkp/ucdp-ged-small.csv?dl=1)


```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(tidyverse)
# dictionary
tribble(~Variable, ~Description, 
        "id", "Unique event identifer",
        "year", "Year event began",
        "month", "Month event began",
        "day", "Day event began",
        "country", "Country of event",
        "type_of_violence", "UCDP violence type\n(1 = state vs. rebel\n2 = rebel vs. rebel\n3 = violence against civilians)",
        "conflict_name", "Name of conflict",
        "side_a", "Side A",
        "side_b", "Side B",
        "source_article", "Article event came from",
        "latitude", "Latitude",
        "longitude", "Longitude",
        "low_death_estimate", "Low estimate of number of deaths",
        "high_death_estimate", "High estimate of number of deaths",
        "best_death_estimate", "Best estimate (sum of all)") %>% 
  pander::pandoc.table()

```



## Questions


Using the dataset, answer the following questions:


1. How many violent events took place in Israel in 2004?


2. How **many more** violent events took place in Afghanistan during the Summer (June, July, August) than in the Winter (December, January, February)? 


3. How many people died (according to "best estimate") in the worst event of state-based violence?


4. In what country was the most (according to "best estimate") violent event of non-state violence perpetrated? 


5. Find a violent event that took place on your birthday (if there are none, try adding/subtracting a day, or month, until you find one). Look up the long/lat coordinates of that event on Google Maps. Using either street view or, if street view is not available, whatever images you can find near the location of the event: 

- take a screencap and save the image (you will upload to Canvas).  
- Where did the event take place? What was the conflict about? Be VERY brief.
- VERY *briefly* describe what the location of the event looks like: nothing structured, just your reactions to what you're seeing in the area. What do you see? What does it look like?
